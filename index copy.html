  <h1>CINDY TRAN!</h1>
    <h2>About Cindy!</h2>
      <p>Hello... I am <strong>Cindy!</strong> I am 17 years old and am obsessed with League and <br>
        Valorant. I also like cats very much and would like one as a pet. I was <br>
        born in Seattle, Washington and have lived here for my entire life. I <br>
        enjoy playing games with my friends and drawing. Baking is something I <br>
        tried taking up over quarantine. It is fun but nobody eats my food :( <br>
      </p><br>
